We are please to release that tiny (2.2K min.gz) library to the public and eager
to start using it inside our bigger projects.

Tonic components are meant to be used via _require_ and packaged within your
application using _[WebPack](http://webpack.github.io)_ or _[Browserify](http://browserify.org)_. But we also provide a _Bower_
independent JavaScript file that can be imported within a Script tag which
will expand the global namespace with a _tonicDataManager_ object.

Please refer to the available documentation for more insight on how that library
can help you in managing your remote data by easing the path to its access.
